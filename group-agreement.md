## Group Agreement  
  
We will be using slack as our main form of communication when not in person.  
There will be no expectation of a response after 9-10pm.  
  
We are expected to be here 9am â€“ 5pm. With an actual lunchbreak somewhere in the middle.  
There is no expectation of afterhours work, but it's ok if someone wants to.  
We will slack the group if we are re working on a feature afterhours.  
No merging afterhours.  
No one merges their own code.  
  
There will be direct and open communication regarding fair balance of work-load.  
If anyone feels like they are struggling, they will let the group know and will ask for help.  
If there is concern about someone pulling their weight, first step will be a check in about external life things, in case something else is going on.  
We will utilize paired programming as a way to ensure that everyone is involved and contributing.  
  
We will have morning, mid-day, and end-of-day check-ins to stay on the same page.   
Verbal confirmation from everyone when decisions are being made (even just a yes or no).  
If discussion of an idea doesn't end in agreement, we will hold a group vote.  
There is the option of a short cooling-off period before a group vote if needed.  
If we are truly stuck (cannot agree on a direction, and group vote results in a tie), we will decide with a coin flip.  
If anyone needs to walk away for any reason, they can say 'narwhal' and walk away, no hard feelings, no questions asked.
